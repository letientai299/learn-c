Some inspirational note about LaTeX, _literal programming_ and some
well-thought about error-handling.

On error handling:

- Don't make user overwhelming by too much information (TMI).
- Think about:
  - What is user going, or suppose to, do with the error?
  - Is receiver a human or another function/program.
  - How can the error be communicated to the user?
